TSPTT
=====
Simple hardware + software project to take an external switch state, via an
Arduino and use it to hold down a PTT key in a VoIP application such as
TeamSpeak.


Arduino
=======
The Arduino used was a Nano as only a single input is needed.  The switch was
connected to link either the ground or +5v rail to digital I/O port 2.

The tsptt.pde source was loaded on, so it prints 0 or 1 (bytes, not ASCII) to
the serial connection on a switch state change.


PC software
===========
The PC software is a small Java app that listens to the serial connection via
the rxtx library and holds/releases the key as required.

It uses port COM3 on Windows, or /dev/ttyUSB0 otherwise by default and has F5
configured as its PTT key.

Usage: TSPTT [COM port] [Key code (int)]


rxtx
====
Windows binaries for rxtx are available from here:
http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Download

Linux distros should carry binaries (rxtx on Fedora, librxtx-java on Debian).

Tested with rxtx-2.2-0.5.20100211 on Fedora and Cloudhopper x86 binaries.
